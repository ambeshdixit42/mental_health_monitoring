Our project aims at creating an all-encompassing system for tracking mental health with modern technologies. Firstly, we suggest developing a real-time voice analysis module ca- pable of accurately predicting emotional states. Next, we plan to add a speech-to-text con- verter that would transcribe oral communications automatically. Thirdly, OpenCV should be employed so that pill consumption levels can be identified, giving insight into whether an individual actually takes it or not. Furthermore, if the personâ€™s voice is sad without any intake of tablets, then the SIM808 module will be used for sending text messages to
his/her relatives for timely intervention.
